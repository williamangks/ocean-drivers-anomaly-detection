# sources.yaml usage:
# Documents the upstream data sources used in the pipeline.
# This file is human-readable metadata (not code) that:
#	- clarifies where data comes from,
#	- clarifies update frequency / time resolution,
#	- helps readers understand acronyms and dataset roles.
#
# Acronyms:
#	- NOAA: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USA)
#	- SST: Sea Surface Temperature
#	- OISST: Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (a NOAA SST product)
#	- ERDDAP: "Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program"
#				A data server that lets you query subsets of datasets over HTTP.
#	- Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a): satellite-derived proxy related to phytoplankton biomass
#	- Reanalysis: model + observations combined to reconstruct consistent historical fields
